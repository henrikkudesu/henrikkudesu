I'm currently studying *Systems Analysis and Development* at Universidade Paulista, in SÃ£o Paulo. I never considered myself good in the field of exact sciences, but I love challenges and that's why I decided to take a chance to overcome myself.

- Currently learning C, C ++, C#, web development and software engineering.
- I really want to learn game development, data science and music. I hope I have enough time for that someday.
- Find me on Discord: Leo#4860
