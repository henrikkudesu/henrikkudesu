I'm currently studying *Systems Analysis and Development* at Universidade Paulista, in SÃ£o Paulo. I never considered myself good in the field of exact sciences, but I love challenges and that's why I decided to take a chance to overcome myself.

- Currently learning Javascript and Go;
- Developed academic projects with C# (using MVC) with SQL and Java. I know the basics of these.
- Studied a lot of C to understand a little bit of memory management, debugging (debugging in C is painful but extremely enjoyable) and a little bit of mid-level programming. "The C Programming LanguageÂ¨ (K&R) is my favorite reference and my favorite programming book of all time;
- I have advanced English for interpretation and writing, basic level in pronunciation;
- Find me on Discord: Leo#4860
