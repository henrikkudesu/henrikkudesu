Sometimes I approach programming as a hobby. I like to code simply and minimally. I'm a big fan of older languages, like C. Not such a big fan of LLMs, but I always use them for accelerated learning.

Currently, I'm part of an IT technician team at T-Systems where I'm responsible for providing support for the Volkswagen production system at the Taubaté plant in São Paulo.

My favorite hobbies include: books, games, weightlifting, and motorcycle trips. And the main one is reading and learning about programming, but I approach it as a hobby, focusing on the joy of learning rather than presenting myself as an expert, which I don’t claim to be.

Here are some of the tools and technologies I use:
